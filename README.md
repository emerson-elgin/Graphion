## Overview

Graphion provides robust tools for graph representation, message passing, pooling, sampling, and advanced GNN models. The library is designed to be:

1. **Scalable**: Efficiently handles large datasets with millions of nodes and edges.
2. **Dynamic**: Supports evolving graphs where nodes and edges change over time.
3. **Hardware-Optimized**: Includes GPU acceleration for computationally intensive tasks.
4. **Modular**: Offers plug-and-play components for easy customization and integration.

## Installation

To install the library, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/graphion.git
cd graphion
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

### 1. Create a Graph Dataset

```python
from gnn_library.graph.graph_utils import Graph

# Define nodes and edges
nodes = 5
edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)]

# Initialize the graph
graph = Graph(nodes, edges)
```

### 2. Perform Node Sampling

```python
from gnn_library.graph.sampling import GraphSampler

sampler = GraphSampler(graph.adjacency_matrix)
sampled_nodes = sampler.node_sampling(num_samples=3)
print(f"Sampled Nodes: {sampled_nodes}")
```

### 3. Train a GCN Model

```python
from gnn_library.models.gcn import GCN
import numpy as np

# Define features, labels, and weights
features = np.random.rand(nodes, 4)
labels = np.array([0, 1, 0, 1, 0])
weights = np.random.rand(4, 2)

# Initialize and train the GCN
gcn = GCN(graph, features, weights)
predictions = gcn.forward()
loss = gcn.compute_loss(predictions, labels)
print(f"Loss: {loss}")
```

### 4. Handle Dynamic Graphs

```python
from gnn_library.graph.dynamic import DynamicGraph

dynamic_graph = DynamicGraph()
dynamic_graph.add_snapshot("t1", [[0, 1], [1, 0]])
snapshot = dynamic_graph.get_snapshot("t1")
print(f"Graph Snapshot at t1: {snapshot}")
```

### 5. Use Large-Scale GNN

```python
from gnn_library.models.large_scale_gnn import LargeScaleGNN

batch_size = 2
large_gnn = LargeScaleGNN(graph, features, weights, batch_size)
large_gnn.train(labels, epochs=10, learning_rate=0.01)
```

### 6. Pooling Operations

```python
from gnn_library.graph.pooling import GraphPooling

pooling = GraphPooling(features)
max_pooled = pooling.max_pooling()
mean_pooled = pooling.mean_pooling()
print(f"Max Pooled Features: {max_pooled}")
print(f"Mean Pooled Features: {mean_pooled}")
```

## Advanced Features

1. **Spectral Analysis**:
   - Perform eigen decomposition on graph Laplacians for advanced graph learning.

2. **GPU Acceleration**:
   - Use CuPy for matrix multiplications to speed up computations.

3. **Batch Processing**:
   - Efficient training on large datasets by dividing them into manageable batches.

4. **Dynamic Graphs**:
   - Handle time-varying graph structures for applications like temporal networks.

5. **Graph Embeddings**:
   - Generate low-dimensional representations for nodes and edges.

6. **Community Detection**:
   - Identify clusters or communities in graphs using modularity-based algorithms.

## Example Applications

1. **Social Network Analysis**:
   - Predict user connections and influence.

2. **Recommendation Systems**:
   - Suggest products or content based on user-item interaction graphs.

3. **Fraud Detection**:
   - Identify suspicious activities in financial or transactional graphs.

4. **Molecular Property Prediction**:
   - Analyze molecular graphs to predict chemical properties.

5. **Dynamic Network Analysis**:
   - Study changes in transportation or communication networks over time.

6. **Community Detection**:
   - Group nodes into meaningful clusters for targeted marketing or segmentation.
